Design Choices
Navigation
React Navigation: Used @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/drawer for navigation. This allows for a smooth and intuitive user experience with a drawer menu.
Custom Drawer Content: Implemented a custom drawer content component to include a close button and additional styling, enhancing the user interface.

Components
HomeScreen, CartScreen, ProductDetailsScreen: These components represent different screens in the app. Each screen is registered with the drawer navigator.
CustomDrawerContent: This component customizes the drawerâ€™s appearance and functionality, including a close button and additional menu items.

Styling
React Native Styles: Used inline styles for simplicity and quick adjustments. The styles ensure a consistent look and feel across different components.


Data Storage
Local State Management: For this example, data storage is managed locally within the components. This approach is suitable for small-scale applications or prototypes.
Future Enhancements: For a production-level application, consider integrating a state management library like Redux or Context API for more complex state management. Additionally, using a backend service or local storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) can help persist data across sessions.
